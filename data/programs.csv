""Three Women"" from different generations discuss the personal changes that occurred after their immigration to Canada and explore how new identities emerged during the adaptation process. Jackie Rosati emigrated from Italy in 1932. She became a nurse and after the war she started a series of volunteer associations to help Italian immigrants. Gianna Patriarca immigrated to Canada in 1960. Although she began as a schoolteacher, she later became an accomplished writer and poet giving voice to Italian-Canadian women. Elena Basile expatriated in 1995 to pursue her Ph.D. While seeking to integrate herself in the Queer community, she discovered the challenges of Canada's multicultural diversity. By exploring changing modes of adaptation at three key historical moments in Canadian history, the documentary ""Three Women"" reveals how various challenges stimulated the women into crossing the boundaries that had held back many of their predecessors. The documentary ""Three Women"" ends with a series of questions about the meaning of adaptation in the new millennium. Join us for a special Q&A with Gianna Patriarca and Italian-Canadian film director and screenwriter, Adriana Monti after the screening of the documentary. In celebration of Italian Heritage Month! Contact the Downsview Branch for more programs and information about how this branch will be celebrating all things Italian for the month of June!
